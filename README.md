# Yo WordPress Pimp My Ride
A small and incomplete collection of WordPress customisations I tend to use, conveniently gathered together in a single class.

- Dequeues jQuery Migrate on front end
- Dequeues wp-embed.js
- Adds .js class to the `html` tag if JavaScript is active
- Removes emoji support
- Replaces percentage symbols in file names
